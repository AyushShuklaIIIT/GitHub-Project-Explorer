## üöÄFuture Improvements

This project has a solid foundation, but there are many ways it could be extended:

- **User Authentication:** Implement GitHub OAuth to allow users to log in.
- **Backend Storage:** Use a backend service like Firebase (Firestore) to save bookmarks and notes to a user's account, allowing them to persist across devices.
- **Starred Repos:** With authentication, fetch and display the user's actual starred repositories from GitHub.
- **Advanced Analytics:** Add more charts, such as commit history over time or issue/pull request activity.
- **Caching:** Implement caching for API requests to improve performance and avoid hitting rate limits.
